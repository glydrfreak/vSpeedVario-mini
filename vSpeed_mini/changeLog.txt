9/20/2018 - (Revert FILTER.h line 83 and vSpeed_mini.ino line 32.) The Temperature was not the problem. It was light hitting the sensor at just the right angle. Reverting changes to the software. Adding a fix for the hardware.

9/19/2018 - (FILTER.h line 83 and vSpeed_mini.ino line 32.) The temperature of the sun was having a very negative effect on the vario as the device passed back and forth from sun to shadow. It would cause the vertical speed calculations to go crazy, and sometimes even crash the device. At the cost of sample rate from 77 to 68, I applied a filter to the temperature data as a 10 second running average. Hopefully this provides the fix.

8/16/2018 - Got rid of the option to not measure battery level. It's just not nessesary to worry about with this prototype.

8/8/2018 - Limitted the transmit rate to Flyskyhy to 30 times per second instead of full speed at 69 times per second. The app seems like it might have had a hard time keeping up and would sometimes glitch with incorrect altitude and/or lift readings at least once every flight. Hopefully this fixes it.

8/2/2018 - Little bit of code cleanup by removing a redundant setting "ENABLE_BLUETOOTH" in "DEFAULT_SETTINGS.h", also removed the feature that disables BLE after two minutes of no connection. (The device will sometimes randomly disconnect from the v^SPEED Android app. Working on a fix.)

5/29/2018 - (vSpeed_mini.ino lines 147-175) fixed each case to be at each third of a battery life.

5/11/2018 - Initial release.
