8/2/2018 - Little bit of code cleanup by removing a redundant setting "ENABLE_BLUETOOTH" in "DEFAULT_SETTINGS.h", also removed the feature that disables BLE after two minutes of no connection. (The device will sometimes randomly disconnect from the v^SPEED Android app. Working on a fix.)

5/29/2018 - (vSpeed_mini.ino lines 147-175) fixed each case to be at each third of a battery life.

5/11/2018 - Initial release.
