8/16/2018 - Got rid of the option to not measure battery level. It's just not nessesary to worry about with this prototype.

8/8/2018 - Limitted the transmit rate to Flyskyhy to 30 times per second instead of full speed at 69 times per second. The app seems like it might have had a hard time keeping up and would sometimes glitch with incorrect altitude and/or lift readings at least once every flight. Hopefully this fixes it.

8/2/2018 - Little bit of code cleanup by removing a redundant setting "ENABLE_BLUETOOTH" in "DEFAULT_SETTINGS.h", also removed the feature that disables BLE after two minutes of no connection. (The device will sometimes randomly disconnect from the v^SPEED Android app. Working on a fix.)

5/29/2018 - (vSpeed_mini.ino lines 147-175) fixed each case to be at each third of a battery life.

5/11/2018 - Initial release.
