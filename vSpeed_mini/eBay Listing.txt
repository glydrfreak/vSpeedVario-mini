<h2>ABOUT</h2>
This is an open source project, with all public files available at the "vSpeed-Vario" repository on GitHub. The v^SPEED mini is based on PROTOTYPE6, which is found within that same repository. This variometer was designed to be compatible with the Arduino IDE for advanced usage, which allows users to modify the existing source code to their pleasure. In another GitHub repository called "vSpeedVario-mini", you will find the most up-to-date source code for use in the Arduino IDE. The hardware is based on another great open source product, Adafruit's Bluefruit Feather M0. The v^SPEED mini is basically just a Bluefruit Feather M0 development board, but without the header pins broken out, and with the added variometer circuitry.
